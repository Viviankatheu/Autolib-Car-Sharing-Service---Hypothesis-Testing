# Autolib-Car-Sharing-Service---Hypothesis-Testing
Author : Vivian Katheu
In Paris, cars are on the road for only about 5% of the time and remain parked the 95% of the remaining time.To address this problem, the autolib company was formed.
Autolib is a car sharing service company that provides easy and convenient access to electric cars, operating in several French cities. There are three types of cars to choose from, the Bluecar(which is the primary car) or the utility cars Utilib and Utilib 14. The service is attained through subscription after which the subscriber receives a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) badge. The scheme allows a driver to rent a car at a station and return it to a station in a different location at a nominal charge. By use of the RFID, an invoice is charged to a subscriber's account on their usage.
In the city of Paris, a driver is estimated to save about 7,000 Euros per year by using the Autolib service in the stead of buying a car.

I am working as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.
The dataset and glossary to use for this project can be found here [http://bit.ly/DSCoreAutolibDataset] and here [Link] respectively.
To work on this project, I will perform the following analysis with Python; 

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording the observations.
Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing.
