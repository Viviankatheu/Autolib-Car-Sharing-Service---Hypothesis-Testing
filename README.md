# Autolib-Car-Sharing-Service---Hypothesis-Testing
Author : Vivian Katheu
I am working as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.
The dataset and glossary to use for this project can be found here [http://bit.ly/DSCoreAutolibDataset] and here [Link] respectively.
To work on this project, I will perform the following analysis with Python; 

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording the observations.
Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing.
